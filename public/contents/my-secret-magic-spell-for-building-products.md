“What if…”

Say it out loud in your head if you want to look for an idea. It’s working for me. Every time when I want to build something for my weekend project or anything else, my brain is full of this.

Once you’ve made a list of ideas, just pick the easiest one. The simplest product to help your life — and you know it’s feasible too. Somehow you’ll find a formula that can create your unique values in that product.

These are mine:

**[TeleDrive](https://github.com/mgilangjanuar/teledrive)**: What if we have unlimited cloud storage for free using the Telegram API?

**[checkbio.me](https://checkbio.me)**: What if we have Linktree alternative which free, unlimited links, and open source?

**[chat-wa.me](https://chat-wa.me)**: What if we can chat with someone with WhatsApp without saving their numbers?

**[restfire.vercel.app](https://restfire.vercel.app)**: What if we can test a simple API with a browser and without login?

**[pro-gamer.vercel.app](https://pro-gamer.vercel.app)**: What if we can teach someone about programming in a fun way?

etc.
