For every programmer, software engineer, or anyone who loves code. Itâ€™s a **must** to have at least one side-project. Why?

### Improve your skills

You can enhance or improve your skills at the main work with a side project.

### Learning by practice

If you want to learn something new and want to challenge yourselves, you can learn with a real project that you work on.

### Doing anything you want

With a side project, you can do anything that you canâ€™t do at the main work â€” without having to care about research, data, analysis, or anything else because you are the only owner of your product.

And when you build a side-project, you should:

### Never afraid of failed

For the first product, you must be failed. Iâ€™m not joking or wanting to demotivate you. But, you can keep learning and improving what you have been done. Evaluate and keep it up!

### Never be afraid of no one will use your product

When you build a product, make sure that it will helpful for yourself â€” build a product that will enhance your productivity or help your daily life activities. So, the first user of your product is yourself and it will always have a loyal user ðŸ¤—

### Money is just a bonus

Donâ€™t think about money for your side-projects. If people like your product, they will help you to keep it running with all costs you need.
