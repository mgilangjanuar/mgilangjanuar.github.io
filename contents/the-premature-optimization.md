**Premature Optimization** is a condition where we place too much focus on optimization over the functionality of the product itself.

We all know many expertise always advise us to avoid this. But, the boundaries are vague.

Making a product works smoothly as a deliverable product is important AND the optimized architecture is really important too. It means if your product takes so much time or space to work on a simple feature, the architecture must be having a problem.

Who wants to use a note-taking app if every time we open it takes more than 5s? Or, who wants to install a ride-hailing app if it has more than 300MB on our phone?

If the optimization of the product depends on how many or how intense people using it, release your product in the waiting list mode. So, you can control who and how many people can use it; do any experiments for building the strong architecture of it; monitor the server usage (memory, CPU, bandwidth, etc); and anything else that necessary.

Please remember, the architecture must be adaptable and have an enhancement space for any new technologies and methodologies in the future. This is for minimizing the unnecessary migration efforts to the new technology — or at least it doesn’t hurt too much. So, you’ll always have improved architecture and can do deliver your product fast.
