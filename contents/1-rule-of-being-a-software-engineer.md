**Trial and Error**

As problem solvers, we have to know this concept. This rule is also for my reminder. If we have tried something and got a failure at least we know how to get that mistake. So, we can try more and error more.

We aren’t a scientist. Don’t do research too much. And we aren’t a doctor. Don’t do diagnosis too much. Try it first!

This rule also works for our life. We’ll never know the result until we’re brave to step it forward.

If we always get an error, at least we know we’re a mistake.
